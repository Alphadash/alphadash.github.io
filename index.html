		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>Always interested in computers, when I was 14 I had my first experience with programming.</br>
		I was playing SA-MP, an online modification for GTA San Andreas which connected players together, but left it up to the players to implement their own gameplay through scripts.</br>
		The language chosen was Pawn, a little-known language described by the developer as "C-like".</br>
		Writing the code and seeing it come alive within the game sparked a passion in me. I had created something, and players were connecting to my server and interacting with what I had made.</br>
I was hooked.</p>

				<td><b>Circle Dodge</b></br>
				A game made in Unity using C#, dodge the lasers for as long as you can.</br>
				Practicing the workflow in Unity, I dealt with timing code to go off in the correct frames, setting up the Unity scenes and communicating between classes initialized in code outside my control. Features a simple anti-cheat (using FixedUpdate()) and persistent - browser permitting - highscores.</td>

				<td><b>Unnamed Multiplayer Shooter</b></br>
				Another game, this one using Java with the libGDX library.</br>
				Made as a school project with a three day deadline, this was the first game I had ever made from scratch. Being unfamiliar with game development and on a tight deadline, the code is very messy and includes a lot of "test" code left as-is when it ended up working.</br>
It is a realtime multiplayer game, with a central server handling all communication between clients. The server is authorative to protect against cheating, but with no delay compensation it works best on local networks.</td>
